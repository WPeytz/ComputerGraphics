    <h2>Part 6 – Written Answers</h2>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <strong>Flat vs. Gouraud vs. Phong shading:</strong><br>
        Flat shading computes one normal per polygon → same lighting across the face (faceted look).<br>
        Gouraud shading computes lighting per vertex and interpolates colors across the surface → highlights may be missed if not at a vertex.<br>
        Phong shading computes lighting per fragment using interpolated normals → best for highlights.<br>
        Based on results in Parts 4 and 5, <em>Phong shading</em> is better for simulating highlights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Directional vs. Point light:</strong><br>
        Directional light has only a direction (like sunlight), no attenuation with distance.<br>
        Point light emits in all directions from a position, intensity decreases with distance (1/r²).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eye position influence:</strong><br>
        Yes. The eye vector affects the specular reflection. Moving the eye changes the highlight position and intensity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Specular term = (0,0,0):</strong><br>
        Removes all specular highlights → object looks matte/dull, only diffuse + ambient lighting remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Increasing shininess exponent (α):</strong><br>
        Higher α → sharper, narrower highlights (glossy).<br>
        Lower α → broader, softer highlights (matte).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coordinate space:</strong><br>
        Lighting is usually computed in <em>view (eye) space</em>, where the camera is at the origin and all vectors are transformed accordingly.
